                    "Hi this is Bhargav from Tap Academy , I am an Electrical student . I have joined in this Tap 
                    Academy in July month. When I joined actually I don't know much about programming, it was really 
                    hard time in my first month but after that a gradual increase in my programming knowledge I have 
                    seen inside me. I tried constantly to gain knowledge and all the faculty in the Tap Academy 
                    provided us best knowledge majorly in java Rohit sir and Megha ma'am . Now I'm very happy that my 
                    programming background is good . The way of teaching and knowledge gave by Rohit sir I could not 
                    forget in my life time , tq Rohit Sir and Megha ma'am.

                    Hello, I am Devendra and I am a fresher from ECE background. I have been enrolled in tap academy 
                    since may 2021 in full stack java development Course. This course has really helped me to achieve 
                    knowledge in java and other laguages like Html, Css and JavaScript. The augmented reality used by 
                    TapAcademy helped me a lot in a detailed manner from the memory point of view. So from my point of 
                    view if anyone asks me about the TapAcademy, I will definitely suggest for this course because it's 
                    worthy. And it really helped me a lot. Thank you Mam, and thanks for the TapAcademy, because it 
                    helped me a lot and in future I will not only gain a job but I am confident that I will sustain in 
                    that job tooo Mam, and this is a basic pillar to me Mam. Thank you once again
                </p>
