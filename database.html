                <dt class="sub">Introduction to Data and Database:</dt>
                <dd>In This section you will learn what is data, what is database and what is management.Why we 
                    will manage database and what is the important of data.</dd><hr>
                <dt class="sub">Data types:</dt>
                <dd>In This section you will learn what are the datatypes that are present in sql, you will learn 
                    all the datatypes with example queries and how to use and what is the use.</dd><hr>
                <dt class="sub">Constraints:</dt>
                <dd>In This section you will learn about different Constraints.These constraints play an essential 
                    role in maintaining data consistency and integrity within a database.They help to minimize 
                    errors and ensure that data is valid and accurate. If you have a specific scenario or question 
                    related to constraints in SQL</dd><hr>
                <dt class="sub">Commands:</dt>
                <dd>In This section you will learn about different Commands.These commands form the core 
                    functionality of SQL and are used to perform various operations on a database.
                    If you have a specific question or need assistance with any of these commands </dd><hr>
                <dt class="sub">Operators:</dt>
                <dd>In This section you will learn about different Operators.These operators are used within the 
                    SQL statements to perform various tasks like filtering data, making comparisons,combining 
                    conditions, and more. If you have a specific question or need assistance with any of these 
                    operators</dd><hr>
                <dt class="sub">Functions:</dt>
                <dd>In This section you will learn about different functions. Functions can vary depending on the 
                    specific database management system (DBMS) you are using, so it's always best to refer to the 
                    documentation for your specific DBMS. If you have a specific question or need assistance with 
                    any SQL function</dd><hr>
                <dt class="sub">Subqueries:</dt>
                <dd>In This section you will learn about Subqueries.Subqueries, also known as nested queries or 
                    inner queries, are a powerful feature in SQL (Structured Query Language) that allows you to use 
                    the result of one query as input in another query. Subqueries are often used to retrieve data 
                    from one table based on data from another table, or to perform complex calculations and 
                    filtering. They can be used in various parts of a SQL statement, such as the SELECT, FROM, 
                    WHERE, and HAVING clauses</dd><hr>
                <dt class="sub">Joins:</dt>
                <dd>In This section you will learn about different types of joins.In SQL, a JOIN operation is used 
                    to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.JOINs are 
                    fundamental for retrieving and working with data from multiple tables in a relational database. 
                    There are several types of JOINs in SQL, each with its specific purpose. </dd><hr>
                <dt class="sub">Normalization:</dt>
                <dd>In This section you will learn about different Normalization.Normalization is a database design 
                    process in SQL (Structured Query Language) that helps structure and organize data in relational 
                    databases to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It is a set of rules and guidelines 
                    for creating tables and defining their relationships to optimize data storage and retrieval. 
                    The primary goal of normalization is to eliminate data anomalies, such as data duplication and 
                    update anomalies, that can occur in a poorly designed database </dd>
